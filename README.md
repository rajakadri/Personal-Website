# Toggle-NavBar
Purpose: Use BS4 to create a responsive Toggle NavBar and regular horizontal NavBar. Depending on the media screen size, one of the two NavBar's will be displayed.

Starting from the Index-HTML file:
- Implemented code for using Bootstrap 4
- Implemented necessary tags (DOCTYPE/HTML/HEAD/BODY)
- Created first nav using BS4 that will be visible when the media screen is 991px or more.
- Created second nav using BS4 that will only be visible when the media screen is 990px or less.
- Created div class with collapse tags to reference when creating the button.
- Used BS4 properties to create button that controls the collapsible second navbar.

Style-CSS file:
- Set the body size to allow for scroll.
- Used 2 @media tags to control which navbar is hidden (actually display: none, not hidden), and which is visible.

Future fixes: Work more with some custom CSS or BS4 properties to arrange the NavBar links and button in a better way.
